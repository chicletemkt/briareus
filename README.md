# About Briareus

Briareus is a collection of template tags which simplifies creating user
interfaces using Bootstrap framework. Although Bootstrap is a great framework,
sometimes it is really boring writing lots of HTML tags to build its components.

It is an app designed to work with Django and Python 3. The goal is to create a
very flexible, yet simple set of tags so you can speed up your development
instead of spending a lot of time writing boring HTML tags and attributes.

# What is this name anyways?

Briareus is the name of a (mithological greek
monster)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatoncheires], with three hundred
hands. We have choosed this name for the project since it stands unique and,
also, have the idea of being an extra "hand" helping on your projects.
